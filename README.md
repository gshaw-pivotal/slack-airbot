# Airbot Slackbot #

A slackbot that you can ask for the current air quality (based on a series of different index measures) at a user specified location. This slackbot is built using Node.js.

## Getting Started ##

```
    git clone
```

## Integration with Slack ##

Bots and apps need to be given permission to integrate with slack. Thus you need to obtain a Slack API token for the bot.

Once a slack api token is obtained, it will need to be provided to the bot as an environment variable named 'token'.

When obtaining the API token you also have to give the bot a name that will be used to address it within slack. We used 'airbot', but you may use whatever name you like.

After the slackbot is running / deployed it will not have access to any channels until invited. Bots are invited just the same as any other slack user.
